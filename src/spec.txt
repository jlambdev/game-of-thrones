** REQUIREMENTS **

Once upon a time there was a series of 5 books about a world where people never live for very long ... Game of Thrones.
 - People all over the world thought it was fantastic, and of course, so did the publisher.
 - So in a gesture of immense generosity to mankind, (and to increase sales) they set up the following pricing
    model to take advantage of the books popularity.
One copy of any of the five books costs £8
 - If, however, you buy two different books from the series, you get a 5% discount on those two books.
 - If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.
 - With 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.
 - If you go the whole hog, and buy all 5, you get a huge 25% discount.
Note that if you buy, four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part
    of a set, but the fourth book still costs £8.
Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket, giving as big
    a discount as possible.

** EXAMPLE **

You can get going with tests for baskets:
 - 0 books
 - 1 book
 - 2 identical books
 - 2 different books

It is not too difficult to work in small steps
 - Start simple
 - Gradually introduce complexity.

For example, how much does this basket of books cost?
 - 2 copies of the first book
 - 2 copies of the second book
 - 2 copies of the third book
 - 1 copy of the fourth book
 - 1 copy of the fifth book
Answer: £51.60
1x 25% discount and 1x 10% discount
